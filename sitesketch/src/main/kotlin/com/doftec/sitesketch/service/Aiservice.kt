You are an expert frontend developer and UI/UX designer. Create a modern, production-ready, single-page portfolio website that dynamically renders all content from a local resume.json file.
You are an expert frontend developer and creative UI/UX designer.

Your task is to generate a fully functional, production-ready, single-page portfolio website that dynamically renders content based on a local JSON file.

üöÄ Objective:
Build a beautiful, modern, mobile-first, fully responsive, single-page portfolio using:

HTML

Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

All content must be rendered dynamically from a local resume.json file (same directory).
The data provide by user is 
 üîΩ Resume JSON:
        $resumeJson
        Use this data to know about profession and style the web page accordingly.

üìÅ Data Source:
Fetch data from ./resume.json. The schema is:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "personalInformation": {
    "fullName": "", "email": "", "phoneNumber": "", "location": "", "linkedIn": "", "gitHub": "", "portfolio": "", "website": "", "media": ""
  },
  "summary": "",
  "skills": [{ "title": "", "level": "" }],
  "experience": [{ "jobTitle": "", "company": "", "location": "", "duration": "", "responsibilities": [""], "toolsUsed": [""], "media": "" }],
  "education": [{ "degree": "", "university": "", "location": "", "graduationYear": "", "gpa": "" }],
  "certifications": [{ "title": "", "issuingOrganization": "", "year": "", "credentialId": "", "credentialUrl": "" }],
  "projects": [{ "title": "", "description": "", "technologiesUsed": [""], "githubLink": "", "liveDemoLink": "", "media": "" }],
  "achievements": [{ "title": "", "year": "", "extraInformation": "" }],
  "publications": [{ "title": "", "publisher": "", "publicationDate": "", "url": "" }],
  "caseStudies": [{ "title": "", "client": "", "description": "", "outcome": "", "media": "" }],
  "licenses": [{ "title": "", "licenseNumber": "", "issuingOrganization": "", "issueDate": "", "expiryDate": "" }],
  "languages": [{ "id": null, "name": "", "proficiency": "" }],
  "interests": [{ "id": null, "name": "" }],
  "references": [{ "name": "", "position": "", "company": "", "email": "", "phone": "" }],
  "mediaGallery": [{ "fileName": "", "fileType": "", "description": "", "url": "" }]
}
üöÄ Core Objectives
100% Dynamic: All content must be fetched and rendered from ./resume.json. No hardcoded values allowed.
Understand the json structure provided and generate a condition based visibility of each section present in structure

Auto-Adaptive: The site should automatically reflect changes or additions to the JSON without requiring any code edits.

Deployment-Ready: The output must be a single, complete HTML file. The user should only need to drop this HTML file and the JSON into the same folder ‚Äî nothing else.

Zero User Edits: Do not assume the user will modify or configure any code. Everything must work immediately and independently.

üì¶ Technical Specifications
Single HTML file only ‚Äî no external JS/CSS files.

Tailwind CSS v3.3 via CDN.

Vanilla JavaScript for all logic and rendering.

No build step required (pure HTML + JS + CDN).

Dynamic Navigation:

Only show links for visible, data-backed sections.

New sections added to JSON should appear automatically in both content and nav.

Safe Rendering:

Do not attempt to render empty/missing sections.

Use optional chaining, safe DOM manipulation, and robust JSON validation.
Zero User Edits: Do not assume the user will modify or configure any code. Everything must work immediately and independently.

Fully Mobile Responsive: The layout, navigation, and content must be optimized for all screen sizes, including phones and tablets.

Hamburger Menu on Mobile: On smaller screens, display a hamburger menu that toggles the navigation.
Adjust the layout according to device size
Add only and only 7 section in navigation not more than that put about,contact,work experience ,project , achievements,education  and skills only ,no other then this if this is not empty if empty then add according to need or profession .
Code should not throw any error please check this.
üß© Dynamic Sections (Render only if data exists)
Render each section only if data is present in resume.json. Always render contact.

Render sections in this order:

Hero (Name, Title, Socials)
hero ‚Üí summary ‚Üí skills ‚Üí experience ‚Üí projects ‚Üí education ‚Üí certifications ‚Üí achievements ‚Üí publications ‚Üí caseStudies ‚Üí licenses ‚Üí languages ‚Üí interests ‚Üí mediaGallery ‚Üí references ‚Üí contact


Contact (Always)

‚ö†Ô∏è Even if a section is empty, its HTML and JS must still exist in the codebase (so it can render if JSON is updated later). But do not render or display the section or nav item if it has no data.

üì¨ Contact Form
Fields: Name (required), Email (required), Subject, Message (required)

Use mailto: handler with pre-filled data

Show a success toast on submission (auto-dismiss)

Disable button while sending
